# MuscleMap commands

MuscleMap provides three command-line tools: `mm_segment` for generating whole-body muscle and bone segmentations, `mm_extract_metrics` for computing region-wise quantitative metrics, and `mm_gui` for visual inspection and quality control. Below is a complete, continuous explanation of all three tools in one block.

A video demonstration is provided below.
