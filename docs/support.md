## Support the MuscleMap project

Your support of MuscleMap will facilitate breakthroughs that both save and transform the lives of children and adults living with debilitating pain and disability. Though MuscleMap has significant potential to reduce the massive economic burden of musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, we have received no federal funding for this project to date. Only by providing MuscleMap with appropriate infrastructure will we be able to serve the billions of people around the world who stand to benefit directly from its application, in multiple ways.

The generous support of our community is the only means by which we will succeed in bringing MuscleMap fully to life, to achieve its extraordinary potential.

It will revolutionise standards of clinical care, providing the foundations for highly personalised and effective treatment plans, with better patient outcomes.

And it will help push the limits of human endurance and performance in the most exciting realms of discovery—perhaps even extending the frontiers of what’s possible for human exploration and existence in deep space.
