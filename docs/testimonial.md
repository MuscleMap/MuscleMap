        My research explores the effects of metabolic benefits from weight loss therapies, and my research team is particularly interested in the relationship between adipose tissue (fat), muscle and cardiovascular health. The MuscleMap is being used in our current study investigating the effects of weight reduction with tirzepatide on muscle composition, and muscle function. The MuscleMap consortium is collaborative, invested in discovering new evidence, and forward thinking in using the most novel and innovative technologies.

        My research examines the effects of human deconditioning. In particular, I investigate lumbopelvic deconditioning and low back pain using a range of methodologies, including magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, kinematic analysis, and functional tasks. MuscleMap is currently used in my ongoing studies investigating the effects of spaceflight and bed rest as a spaceflight analogue. The platform provides a robust and innovative framework for quantitative muscle and fat analysis, which is essential for addressing our research questions. The MuscleMap consortium is highly collaborative, strongly committed to generating new scientific evidence, and forward-thinking in its adoption of novel, cutting-edge technologies. I see MuscleMap as a valuable and evolving tool for musculoskeletal research in both clinical and spaceflight contexts.
